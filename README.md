# Studio Workshops - Fall 2023
## Welcome to Studio Dojo!
Unity is a powerful cross-platform game engine that's also great for getting started with game development. Many popular games you may have played, including *Pok√©mon Go*, *Hearthstone*, *Genshin Impact*, and *Hollow Knight*, were developed with Unity, but the engine also provides many tools for newcomers to learn with minimal coding.

In this weekly workshop series, you will learn the fundamentals of game development and the Unity game engine, skills which can also be applied to other game engines and projects. If you have never coded or used a game engine before, this is the perfect series for you! Live workshops will take place in **Boelter 4760** from **7 PM - 9 PM on Tuesdays**, but if you can't attend in person, we will have our complete projects uploaded on Github.
