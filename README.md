# Studio Intro Tutorials - Winter 2023
## Welcome to the Intro Track!
Unity is a powerful cross-platform game engine that's also great for getting started with game development. Many popular games you may have played, including *Pok√©mon Go*, *Hearthstone*, *Ori*, and *Escape from Tarkov*, were developed with Unity, but the engine also provides many tools for newcomers to learn with minimal coding.

In this workshop series, you will learn the fundamentals of game development and the Unity game engine through a 4-part interactive tutorial series where we'll attempt to build a tower defense game from scratch. If you have never coded or used a game engine before, this is the perfect series for you! Live workshops will take place in **Boelter 4760** on some Tuesdays and **Bunche Hall 3178** on some Wednesdays from **6 PM - 8 PM**, but if you can't attend in person, you can follow along with our detailed GitHub READMEs and we will also be attempting to record and upload our tutorials.

We also offer the [Special Topics Track](https://github.com/uclaacm/studio-advanced-tutorials-f21) and [Creative Track](https://github.com/uclaacm/studio-creative-tutorials-f21). The Special Topics Track covers more complex coding concepts and systems, but we encourage you to check it out if you have prior coding experience, even if you haven't used Unity before. The Creative Track focuses on non-coding aspects of game development, such as animation, writing, and sound design, and is also open to newcomers learning Unity through our beginner track. *Note these are last years tutorial tracks.
